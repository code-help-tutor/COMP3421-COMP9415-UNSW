# Cpp101

## Introduction

This is a small repo to get you up to speed with what subset of C++ we will be using in the course.

It is already assumed you are proficient with C and its peculiarities.
To that knowledge, we add:
- C++ namespaces
- references
- an emphasis on const-correctness
- C++ keywords that replace C's.
- function pointers
- C++ standard library containers (`std::vector`, `std::string`, `std::array`)
- C++ standard library streams (`std::cout`, `std::cerr`)
- function overloading
- C++ `using` declarations


## How To Use
There is extensive documentation in `include/cpp101/fold.hpp` and `src/main.cpp` on all the various constructs.

If you're pressed on time (or are lazy like we are), reading through this should be sufficient.

If you have 40 minutes to kill, [you can watch this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DStoqQnUxc&ab_channel=MarcChee) which goes through the subject matter.
